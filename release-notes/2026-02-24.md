# Release Notes - 2026-02-24

## Summary
- Added permanent operating-model artifacts to enforce daily release discipline, release-note hygiene, and idea-board governance.

## Changes
- Added `docs/process/system-foundations.md` defining long-term project discipline, structural layers, full-stack scope, and systems ground rules.
- Added release-notes conventions and reusable template.
- Added idea-board conventions and an initial board with seeded entries.
- Linked these artifacts from `README.md` and `docs/mvp-blueprint.md`.

## Risks / Known Issues
- Process docs are now normative; engineering templates/checklists may need follow-up automation in CI.

## Rollback Plan
- Revert this commit to remove governance artifacts and references.

## Validation
- Verified markdown files render and references resolve in repository tree.
